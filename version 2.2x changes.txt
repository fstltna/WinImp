version 2.2.18 changes:
-missed some changes for offline mode and added functionality to be able to go offline mode when server
is disable or down (Ron Koenderink)

version 2.2.17 changes:
-added Offline mode - limited functionality, viewing of local db only. (Ron Koenderink)

version 2.2.16 changes:

version 2.2.14 changes:
-removed the "Ship Stats" table from the database. This table was static and never being refreshed
from the server.  But, the ship stats data was being loaded into the "Build Info" table.  So I
replaced all references to "Ship Stats" (in the Range Tool) with "Build Info". Note that this makes 
2.2.14 databases incompatible with all previous versions.  Older databases should still work with
2.2.14, but I haven't tested this..  This change was necessary to ensure compatibility with LOTR-II.
The bug was pointed out by Jeff Cotter.
-Removed some hardcoded values from the Range tool (dealing with land firing ranges) and replaced
them with database references as above.
-added for additional exploration modes (Ron Koenderink)
-corrected Map wraparound in OffsetSectorLocation (used in exploration and other places) (Ron Koenderink)

SetThresh function needed in frmPromptThresAll, SetSectorLabels function in frmPromptLoad,
DesignateHex in frmToolWOrldBuild, LoadCombo in frmPromptFleet, ToggleHex in frmPromptTerritory,
finished removal of strString in frmWarload and frmPromptFuel (Ron Koenderink)
-fixedEmpireError Added CStr to Application versions and removed semicolon (Ron Koenderink)
-add support for civilians on supply type land units (Ron Koenderink) 

version 2.2.13 changes:
-Fixes by Ron Koenderink to launch, bomb, and paradrop.
-Major code cleanup by Eric James (removed a *bunch* of unused variables and procedures)
-fixed a bug in the sector tab maximize button that caused the status bar to disappear when you
restored the unit panel.  Also changed it so that the maximum button has an icon that actually
looks like a maximize icon instead of the 'X' which looked exactly like a close icon...
-sector panel will now tell you which of your 'c' (or '^') sectors is your national capital and
which ones are just spare capitals.
-Move All box now shows mobility used like Move box does.

version 2.2.12 changes:
-several internal changes in the Famine Relief tool in preparation for extensions in the next
release.  These changes should not affect the functionality.  Please let me know if Famine
Relief gives you any problems
-minor Bug fix in Login procedure
-Bug fix in Show Report (Capabilities) thanks to Ron Koenderink.
-Fixed a minor bug involving scripted "zdone y" which could cause a crash (no one probably ever
got bit by this, but I use scripted zdones a lot in my testing)
-Bug fix in Distribution Tab where the text is not big enough to hold titles like radar installation (Ron Koenderink)
-Added new designation information to Distribution Tab (Ron Koenderink)
-Bug fix in Show Report where statistics were at a different tech level then capabilities and build (Ron Koenderink)
-Bug fix in Ctrl-T (Threshold All) would crash if done on a sea or unknown sector. (Ron Koenderink)
-Added the 'Show All' box back to the Move prompt (but it still doesn't seem to work perfectly?)

version 2.2.11 changes:
-slightly better handling of "v" and ":" sectors for IW5 folks.  The production summary tool
doesn't include them yet though.  That code needs a total rewrite, which I will do eventually...
-explore prompt will now actually explore with more than 1 civ per sector if you ask it to
-MoveAll command does not automatically display the Units tab for no reason
-Changed things so that long announcements are wrapped and displayed properly (of course, WinACE
will still *generate* long telegrams and announcements, but now at least it can display it's own
announcements properly.  I'll fix it so that it generates proper telegrams RSN).
-Removed 'Show All' checkbox from the Move prompt because I don't see any reason that it could
ever possibly be useful, and every time I click it (on accident) it seems to screw up the 
command and the server says "unrecognized item '4'".  

version 2.2.10 changes:
-Fixed that horrible bug where a parse error with ship orders would corrupt the database
and cause WinACE to crash with "Error 94, Invalid use of Null" everytime the cursor went
over that ship.  Also fixed a few other minor bugs.

version 2.2.9 changes:
-Fixed a bug similar to the bank bug fixed in 2.2.8, but affecting d, i, and % sectors.
(Threw in "v" sectors as well for you IW4 folks...)
-Fixed a minor inconsistency regarding retreat settings in the navigation dialogs

version 2.2.8 changes:
-Fixed a bug where production calculations for banks was incorrect
-Fixed a bug where f/h/!/* sectors would not display the proper amount of avail to be produced.

version 2.2.7 changes:
-Added an option to the relations grid to vary the width of the columns at the request of some IW4
players who said that they couldn't fit all the countries on one screen.
-Added support for the SLOW_WAR states to the relations grid.  Not that anyone really ever plays
SLOW_WAR, but I thought while I was redoing that code anyway, I should add it for completeness.

Version 2.2.6 changes:
Pretty much everything in version 2.2.6 is due to Thomas Lullier.  Expect it to remain that way for a 
few more months, as I'm pretty busy right now.  Anyone else who wants to start contributing, feel free...

- added the warload command : load 999 mil/gun/shell/oil/pet/food in ships ou land units
this command needs to be tweaked to prevent oil/pet and food load if NOFUEL and/or NOFOOD
- typo corrected in "Launch" box
- auto select unit type to be loaded when 'plane' or 'land' is clicked in load box
- auto "show sect s" at winace run when autoupdate on - (should work at update - not tested).  
This should help out with RESPOP games.
- an additional check for max prod against 'material_limit'
- a new option 'max prod instead of max pop' (a toggle for idle civ - example: a 100% radar with 760 civ 
  has 759 civ idle (for max prod, as in 2.10) or missing 8 civ (for max pop, as in2.11b) )


Version 2.2.5 changes

-Added some more buttons to the toolbar, including some that had been missing from 2.1.1, and others added
thanks to Thomas Lullier.
-Production code from 2.1.1 merged in (but beware, there are several known bugs in this code.  They will be
fixed in the next release).

Version 2.2.4 changes

Bug Fixes
=========

-Sector designation had gotten screwed up last release.  Fixed it.  I also integrated a lot of the 2.1.1 changes
from the file empcommon.bas.  Hopefully, this has fixed bugs that no one has found yet.

Version 2.2.3 changes

Bug Fixes:
==========

 The Show report was all messed up.  When copying it over from 2.1.1, I seem to have forgotten to copy about
half the code.  I think it should all be fully functional now.  If not, someone please tell me.

Version 2.2.2 changes

General
=======

-I have obtained from Jim Simons the source code to v2.1.1, the LOTR-enchanced version, as well as unreleased
source code of the latest things he was working on before he stopped working on WinACE.  I am now in the
process of integrating these changes back into my source tree.  Some of the easy ones have been integrated
already, look for most of the rest in my next release.  The notable ones so far are:
  -The new Show report is back in
  -Color scheme can now be set by distribution sector.

Bug Fixes
=========

-Giving a ship a "sail" command and then attempting to look at it's orders with "sorder" would cause a parse
error.  Fixed.

Minor Enchancements
===================

-Rudimentary Support for an "exec" command added.  You can now type "exec script1.txt" at the prompt to execute
a script, or embed that within a script to have scripts call other scripts.  This does not utilize the 
empire server execute command, it simply reads lines from the file and submits them one at a time.  
Some scripts won't work exactly perfectly when being exec'ed. YMMV.  

-The Threshold and Threshold All prompts can now automatically push or pull supply from distribution centers
to adjust the level of commodities in a sector the match the new threshold.

-The feeder tool enchancements I made in 2.2.0 could get a little BTU intensive.  Made it a little more intelligent
in order to use fewer BTUs.



Version 2.21 changes

Bug Fixes
=========

-Typing "sorder" would hang the console.  Fixed so that it properly asks for a fleet number instead

-If a bogus order was given, WinACE would not grok the "no route possible" message from sorder.  Fixed.

-Relations grid really works this time (I hope!)

-Plague risk is now calculated correctly (I think.  The game I'm currently playing has NO_PLAGUE enabled,
so I won't be getting much chance to test it.  If people who are currently playing plague games could let
me know if it is fixed, that would be great)

Minor Enchancements
===================

-There is now an optional auto bmap refresh when ships stop.

-Ships can now autolook as they are navigating (they could before, but only if you specified the full path
or destination sector ahead of time.  Now, you can move sector by sector, and look at every sector.)

Version 2.20 changes

Bug Fixes
=========

-The nation level tool was apparently not calculating Education and Happiness correctly. Probably it was
written for an earlier version of the server and never updated. It was updated to match the algorithm used 
by Empire 4.2.10

Major Enhancements
==================

-Added a Relations Grid tool to the Diplomacy menu that will show the relations of everybody towards
everybody in a color coded grid so that you don't have to run the relation command 10 times to get a 
feel for the current political climate.


Minor Enhancements
==================

-The famine relief tool can now automatically set food thresholds to the required values.

-Popup context menus are a little more context sensitive.  E.g., the "Fire" option is grayed out on non-fort
sectors, "Radar" is disabled for non-radar sectors, etc.
