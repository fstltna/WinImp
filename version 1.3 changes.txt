Version 1.3 changes

Note - These are changes from 1.2  Some of
these changes made it into Version 1.21

Fixed bug.  WorldX, WorldY were not
always being set from the version record 
when program started. Resulted in crash 
with Error 380

Fixed bug.  Parsing error generated on
land units when windows country settings
are such that a comma is used as decimal
separator (French).  Forced code to always
use period as decimal separator, regardless
of Windows country settings. 

Fixed bug.  Clicking a selection button
on the unit toolbar when there are no 
units in the box caused a crash.

Fixed bug.  Telegram box allowed hitting reply
with no message chosen.  Caused crash

Fixed bug.  Changing country setting in
Windows could cause Magnification entry 
in the registry to become invalid if 
the decimal symbol changed.  Put a check
in to fix invalid magnification entries.
Similar check put in for the command 
box height setting

Fixed bug.  Not picking up max land efficiency
gain from version report.  No effect on client
prior to version 1.3

Fixed bug.  Launch command not updating
plane positions (needed for satellites)

Fixed bug.  Country number not being 
picked up on program entry.  This caused 
recon and sat to incorrectly mark its own
units as enemies.

Added code to save fertility and oil 
ratings of sea sectors from view of
fishing boats/oil derricks, etc. to the
local database.  These values are 
displayed in the sea hexes when
a Graduated Color Scheme based on fert or
ocontent is used.

Added code to script editor so that lines
with a & in front would be taken as 
responses to server queries.

Modified explore circle command to act
more like nova - i.e. it will request a 
wider map and keep going up to the radius
specified.  Added check not to abandon the
sector

Reading the version report now updates the
version variables, including worldx, worldy.

Winace now dumps a nation command on entry
and after updates.  Gets the tech, education,
research, reserves and other figures.

Build box now only shows units available at
your current tech level.

Added option to change the font of the command 
display window (Alt F) on the map screen.

When navigating using fleet designations,
WinACE will now check to see if it needs 
to update land and air positions also

Fixed bug.  Telegram timestamping now
takes into account client being in a 
different time zone than server.

Updated Transport prompt box to allow
use of waypoints, similar to move.  Just
press the space bar when the cursor is 
in the destination text box.

Added torpedo sighted to Event Markers
from incoming bulletins.

Added update player list to view menu.

Had mouse move check to see if the sector
had changed before updating status box. 
Reduced flicker.

Re-wrote screen draw routines to optimize
some critical loops and speed up drawing.
Resulted in minor improvement in refresh rate.

Added bridge towers to the build dialog box

Automatic subsetting on unit display.  When
paradroping, only "transport" units show up in
unit box, etc.

New Features +
++++++++++++++

Best Path/Mobility Cost
========================
March/Nav, Transport, and Move dialog
boxes will now compute mobility cost
of projected moves.  Option to graphically
show "best path" as well.


Unit Display Box now part of Sector Box
========================================
Separate Unit Display that would pop up and
down is now a third tab on the Sector Display
Box.  Box is automatically switched to that
tab when units are needed.  


Sector Box Census Display has 5 new fields
=========================================
FR - Food required - This is the food required
to feed the population of the sector AND insure
maximum growth.  It does not take into account
any that could be grown and harvested in the
sector, so it is a conservative number, usually
larger than the "prevent starvation" requirement.
If there is less food than required in the sector,
this number will show up in red.  This number is
still calculated for blitz games, but can be 
ignored.

Pd - Production.  Shows how much the sector will
produce at the update (you should know what it produces)
based on the workforce and the resource limits.
Harbors, airports, and headquarters show avail.
Does not consider that if you starve people you will
not get full production.  It assumes you have 
provided enough food for full population growth.

Mx - Maximum Production.  The max that could be
produced based on the workforce currently in the
hex if all the raw materials needed were present.

Civ - Excess or Shortage of Civs.  If there are 
more civs in a hex than needed to bring the hex
to 100% and convert all the raw materials, the
excess is shown here in black.  If more civs 
are needed to process all the raw materials 
available, the shortage is shown here in red.
Note that harbors, airports, headquarters, and 
mines can always use more civs, up to MAX SAFE 
POP (768 in most 60 ETU games) so if they are
below that number, the difference will show
in red.   Warehouses, radar, bridges, etc
will show everyone but one in black once
they are 100%, since they don't need a staff.

NE - New efficiency.  The efficiency of the hex
after the next update.  Does not take into account
BIG_CITIES

Note - the above fields are only valid when
connected to a game, and the "nation" values are 
known.  They are not correct when playing off line.


Pop up menus organized into sub menus
=====================================
Soon as you left click you will see this one.
Figure it will raise some controversy, but I
kind of like it.  Main need is to identify 
common commands that should be on the first
level of each menu.


Prompt box changes
=====================================
A few changes to make the prompt boxes 
easier to use.

1) Move box now only shows the items
   actually in the sector.  There is
   a display all check box in case you
   want to build scripts or run "what ifs"

2) Cursor does not have to be on the 
   destination/target box to have it 
   filled in when a sector on the map
   is clicked.  This saves an extra
   click back on the prompt.  True for 
   Move, Launch, Transport, March, and Nav.

3) Left clicking on the map when a prompt
   box is up is the same as pressing the
   "execute" button on the box.  This saves
   having to move the mouse back down to the
   OK button after clicking on a sector on the
   Map.

This means to move something, you can now
left click to bring up the box, click on the
item from a shorter list, type in the amount,
right click then left click on the destination, 
sector to fill it in the box and execute the move.


Build Projection Tool
=====================
Click on a harbor, airport, or headquarters
and then choose this tool.  It will bring up
a projection of how your ships/planes/units 
will increase in efficiency in that sector at
the update, including showing you where your
short.  You can change the starting amounts
of materials to project "what if" figures.
You can even "add" units by using the build
queue, which shows you the effect of building
new units without your having to actually
start them.

This tool will have to be updated when wolfpack
introduces the new changes where guns are
no longer required to build units.

Best/Average/Worst Case - when building a unit,
empire does not use fractions of a materials.  
Instead, there is a % chance that either zero or
one unit is used.  (Example - if a linf needs 1
gun to be built, and its going from 30 - 100 %, 
then it needs .7 guns.   This translates into
a 70% chance it will use 1 gun, and a 30% chance
it will use 0.)

Lets say your bringing 10 linf up from 30%-100%

if you choose best case, the build projector will
assume you always make the 30% chance, and thus use
no guns.  This is a "best you can get" for when
you are short on materials and need to know how much
cash could be spent.

if you assume worst case, the build projector will
assume you always miss the 30% chance, and thus use
10 guns.  Making sure you have enough materials to 
cover worst case will insure all your units fully
build, regardless of how the odds play out.

if you assume average case, then it will try to 
balance things out, and you will use ABOUT 7 guns.


Famine Relief Tool
==================
This is an auto feed tool that will feed starving
populations from a food source hex semi
automatically.  It projects how much food and
mob will be used in the process, so it takes
a few seconds to run the calcs.   Currently it
works only on the FR figure calculated by WinACE.
I intend to enhance it to work just the starvation
levels if that’s all that’s desired, but I need a 
long term game to finish developing that option.

Range specifies the maximum distance it will 
distribute the food.  Food and mob specify how
much food/mob must be left in the hex after
distribution is done.  If numbers show red 
in the grid, it means the source site does
not have enough food or mob to reach that
sector.  You can change the distribution order
by clicking on the top of the columns so that
it goes by shortest path or shortest mob cost
first if you want it that way.


Nation Levels Tool
==================
This is a fairly easy to understand tool.  It
predicts your nation levels as of the next update
(Education, Tech, Happiness, Research).  You can
project out multiple turns if you want.
You also can play what if scenarios 

(Example:  If I put 100 more lcms in the
library, what will my edu be next turn ?)

Only thing not predicted is tech/research bleed.
You have to fill the estimate for that in yourself.


Attack Menu Changes
===================
Several new options have been added to the 
attack menu

1) Probe - This does a "fake" attack, committing 
   no troops, but showing you what’s in the sector.
   Does not update the enemy data base at this time.

2) Attack - Pulls up the attack prompt box.

3) Assault - Pulls up the assault prompt box

4) Bomb - Pulls up the bomb prompt box, with the
   target sector already put in.  The unit box
   will show only bombers that are in range of the
   target, along with their range to target in red.

5) Bomb - Pulls up the paradrop prompt box, with the
   target sector already put in.  The unit box
   will show only transports that are in range of the
   target, along with their range to target in red.

6) Missile Strike - Pulls up the launch box, with the
   target sector already put in.  The unit box
   will show only missiles that are in range of the
   target, along with their range to target in red.


Attack Prompt Box Changes
=========================
This box has been enhanced to let you choose the
answers to the common attack questions quickly 
ahead of time.

1)   Support - clicking on the support box itself will
     cancel/call for full support.  You can turn off/on
     an individual option by clicking it separately

2)   Attack Force - The top three options allow you to
     control the amount of mil committed to the attack.
     Leaving the option on the default of Prompt will
     mean you are prompted sector by sector by the server
     as normal.  Choosing "All" means that all available
     mil will be used in the attack (WinACE auto answers 
     the servers prompts)  The third option allows you
     to specify exactly how many mil will participate 
     in the attack.  If you say you want x mil, then
     WinACE again answers all the prompts, committing
     the first x mil the server asks about. 

3)   Attacking Units - When this prompt comes up, the
     Unit box will show only the units in range to 
     participate in the attack.  If you leave the 
     unit box blank, then you will be prompted unit
     by unit as normal.  If you enter one or more
     unit numbers here by clicking on the units in
     the unit box, then WinACE will auto answer
     the unit prompts, committing only the units you
     indicated.  A Y or N in this box will commit
     all or none of the available units, and the Y
     and N buttons are available to allow you to 
     quickly choose these options.

4)   The Move in section is similar to the attack force,
     but it controls the number of military that will
     occupy the sector after your victory.  The only
     new option here is "1", in case you just want the
     bare minimum needed to hold the hex.  The unit
     box in this section controls which units will
     move in after the attack.


Assault Prompt Box Changes
=========================
This box has been enhanced to let you select ships
and the assault force quickly. 


1)   Support - Similar to the attack box above, 
     clicking on the support box itself will
     cancel/call for full support.  You can turn off/on
     an individual option by clicking it separately

2)   Ship select - the ship select will show the ships
     in range to assault, along with the approximate
     assault strength of each ship (taking into account
     mil and units).  These numbers assume the assault
     is contested, since a full ships complement can
     be landed on an uncontested beach.  The ship with 
     the highest assault strength is automatically 
     selected. You can select a different ship or enter 
     a ship number of your own.  

3)   Attack Force - This is the same as in the attack
     box, so read the explanation there.

3)   Attacking Units.  The list box to the right of 
     the assault prompt box shows the units on the 
     selected ship that can assault.
     Click on units in the list box to select/deselect
     them, rather than using the units box.
     Other than that, this box performs the same as 
     the Attacking Units box in the attack command.

Note that the Assault box does not have any options 
to allow you to select the occupying force, since 
everyone who participated in the assault automatically
goes ashore.
