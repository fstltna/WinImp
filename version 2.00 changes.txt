Major Enhancements
==================
Rewrote map scrolling and boundry functions.  Map will now let you
scroll past the "end of the world" and will handle wrapping. 
Large change scroll is now based on magnification rather than
a fixed 10 rows, and is about 3/4 of a screen.  Extensive re-write
to Map Drawing routines cut screen refresh times in half.
Zoom menu enhanced to allow faster zoom/unzoom

Tightened error handling routines to better trap and report errors and
hopefully limit crashes.  Added an error log that is created on disk
when an error is encountered.

Added nuke support.
1) Mark Nuke option added to Unit Menu to highlight 
   sectors with nukes
2) Message field in sector box now shows the number 
   and type of nukes in the sector
3) Transport prompt box now works for nukes (but only 1 at a time)
4) Build and show prompt boxes now work for nukes
5) Nuke menu appears on left click if there are nukes in the sector
6) Arm and Disarm now forces update of nuke information

Added Sector Damage analysis
Shelling, bombing, or launching at a sector now returns what the
client thinks is the new efficency of the sector after the damage
is applied.

Updated Build Projection Tool 
1) now treats forts like headquarters, but doesn't allow builds
2) now defaults to worst case.
3) Allows selection of current or update avail
4) Saves the avail selections for each of the four sector types
to the local database
5) Added a Next Button to jump to next sector with builds

Added Plane Combat Parsing and Report.
WinACE now parses plane combat reports and will give a report on 
enemy planes encountered and their current efficenecy.  Is cumulative
over multiple battles, and resets at the update.

Added Production Summary Report.  
Shows production figures and a number of "Error" messages, either 
for your country as a whole, or for a selected distribution center.
Does not take into account delivery!!
When run for a distribution center, will calculates the amount of 
mobility used by dist center to fill all threshold requests.

Added logic to calculate fire ranges for forts, ships, and land 
units.  Added information now shows up on fire prompt box, and 
new Range Table tool.  Added logic to show plane ranges and 
estimated flight mobility costs on plane flight prompt boxes.

Added logic to parse version options, and support BIG_CITIES and
GO_RENEW

Added export most recent telegrams that will export only the
telegrams not yet exported.  Puts them in sequentially numbered files
so they don't overwrite.  Good for co-rulers to update each other on 
missed tele's

Mapped all keyboard input when on main screen to go to the command
line - should help command line users and avoid the loss of focus
problem.


Minor Enhancements
==================
Moved some common plane and ship commands back to main pop up menu.

Added logic to immediately update the unit box when updated unit
information is read in.

Changed telegraph delete function so it jumps to the prior telegraph
in the list, makes it easier to delete a batch of telegrams.

Log file added.  Program now outputs history of session to log file.
Keeps last 5 logs per game.

Added message marker for missile attacks.

Page up and Page on the map screen will now scroll the command 
results display box.

Increased Zoom options and moved to a sub menu.  Now can enter 
magnification level desired for faster zoom in/zoom out.

Moved display options to a sub menu.  Added an option to have
the command result box not reset on new commands.

Updated designate box to allow default thresholds to be loaded 
from and saved to the registry.

Show expanded to have the basic show options available as a 
seperate menu choice.
